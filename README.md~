# Sharepoint Sync Tool

This tool can sync Sharepoint (and OneDrive for Business) document libraries
with local filesystems.

## Requirements
- Tested on Python 3.6.
- Should work on Python 3.4+, may work on Python 2.7.
- Requires Office365-REST-Python-Client

## Usage

The first time you sync a site, do this:

    obsync.py -u me@myorg.com ./LocalPath 'https://mysharepoint.sharepoint.com/sites/SiteName/' 'Remote Path'

This will ask you for a password; you can also specify `--pw=MyPassword` on the
command-line if you're okay with your password ending up in your command
history.

The last parameter, the remote path, can be either:

- An absolute path such as `/sites/MySite/Shared Documents`; or
- A path relative to your site, such as `Shared Documents`.

`Shared Documents` is the usual name of the document library on a site but you
can sync whatever folder on the SharePoint site you like.

Note that the `Shared Documents` folder commonly contains a `Forms` folder which
most clients hide but this one doesn't.  Its contents are more about how
Sharepoint works than your document library.

Subsequently, you can do this:

    obsync.py ./LocalPath

though if you want to put the whole command-line again, you can.

## Notes

The tool maintains a database in `./LocalPath/.sync.db`.  Don't mess with it.

Your password is stored in plain text in the database.

### TODOs

 - Store the authentication token in the database and only request a new one
   when it doesn't work.
 - Add a command-line option to not store the password in the database and
   request it every time it's needed.
